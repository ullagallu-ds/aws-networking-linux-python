- It is a compute service offerring different types of machine to deploy any type of workloads it is scalable and highly available computing service 
- You can pay what you use no upfront payment[pricing flexibility]
- variety of instances[memoory optimized,compute optimized,disk optimized,GPU based]
- secure by using sg and key-value pairs
- easy to integrate with aws services
- majorly prefer amazon linux only

Restart the ec2 instance

EIP = It is a static IP generally every restart of instance ip will be change to preserve IP address change we can use EIP
